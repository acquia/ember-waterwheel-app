# How to contribute

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We're hoping this project will increase 
community interest in integrating Drupal with decoupled Ember applications to create awesome new things.

## Testing

@todo

## Submitting changes

Please submit a Pull Request on GitHub with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 
Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make your commits atomic (one feature per commit). If applicable, please
add automated tests as well.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes 
should contain a paragraph or bulletted list describing the changes.

## Coding conventions

Please use coding conventions consistent with existing code, and optimize for readability.

  * Indent using two spaces (no tabs, please)
  * Use semicolons at the end of statements
  * Add code comments when the function of the code is not obvious
  * Code lint-ing will automatically be performed while building the code with ember-cli. Please ensure that your code
  does not trigger any errors or warnings  
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and do your best to make it look nice for them.

Thank you again!
